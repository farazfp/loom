**Simin Behbahani (1927-2014)**, born Siminbar Khalili, was a luminary in the realm of contemporary Persian poetry. Her work, characterized by its innovative blend of traditional forms and modern themes, marked her as an icon of modern Persian literature and a beloved figure in Iran's intellectual and literary circles.

## Early Life and Background

Simin was born into a family deeply rooted in literature and culture. Her father, Abbas Khalili, was a poet, diplomat, newspaper publisher, and editor, while her mother, Fahr-Ozma Arghun, was a progressive poet and French language teacher. This rich literary environment deeply influenced Behbahani's early foray into poetry. She began writing at the age of twelve and published her first poem at fourteen​[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simin_Behbahani)​.

## Literary Career

Behbahani’s poetic journey started under the influence of Nima Yooshij's "Char Pareh" style, but she soon found her voice in the ghazal, a classical Persian poetic form. Unlike her predecessors, Behbahani expanded the ghazal beyond its traditional confines, infusing it with contemporary themes, theatrical subjects, and daily conversations. Her approach to poetry was neither strictly modern nor traditional but comfortably straddled both realms, making her a significant figure in 20th-century Persian literature​​​[](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/behbahani-simin-2-poetry)​.

Her first verse collection, "Setar-e shekasteh" ("The Broken Setar"), published in 1951, set the stage for a prolific career that saw her repurpose classical Persian poetic forms to explore and comment on contemporary social and political themes. Behbahani's unique approach was particularly notable for inverting the traditional ghazal structure, often using a female narrator, a significant departure from the norm at a time when more classical forms were waning in popularity​[](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Simin-Behbahani)​.

## Themes and Style

Behbahani is celebrated for pushing the aesthetic boundaries of classical Persian poetry. She was adept at creating thematic unity within her ghazals, a departure from the form's traditional structure of independent couplets. Her poetry often tackled societal issues, particularly concerning women's rights and political conditions in Iran. She expressed new subject matters within the ghazal structure, addressing complex issues like war, poverty, lawlessness, and tyranny with an autobiographical voice and everyday speech​[](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/behbahani-simin-2-poetry)​.

## Personal Life and Legacy

Behbahani's life was not without its challenges. In 2010, she faced governmental prohibition from leaving Iran, highlighting the controversial nature of her work and her status as a critical voice in Iranian society. Despite these challenges, she remained a beloved and respected figure, both as a national treasure in Iran and as a global feminist icon​[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simin_Behbahani)​.

Simin Behbahani's poetry continues to resonate with readers worldwide, her work a testament to the enduring power of Persian literary culture to address universal human experiences. She remains a towering figure in Persian literature, her poetry a bridge between the traditional and the contemporary, the personal and the universal.
