Rahi Moayeri was a distinguished Iranian poet known for his eloquence in Persian ghazals and his mastery in transcribing emotions into words. He was born into a prominent family in Tehran on May 1, 1909, the son of Mohammad Hassan Khan Mo'ayyer al-Mamalek (Mo'ayyed al-Khalvat) and the grandson of Dost Ali Khan Mo'ayyer al-Mamalek (Nizam al-Dowleh). His mother, Fakhri Hajazi (Fakhr al-Alam), descended from Mirza Ahmad Khan Mo'shir al-Sultan, a prime minister during the Constitutional Revolution.

Rahi lost his father six months after birth and was called "Boyuk" until maturity. From childhood, he was deeply interested in poetry, music, and painting. He studied at Dar al-Fonun and, after military service, joined the civil service, working in various departments, including the municipality of Tehran and ministries of labor and arts. He retired as the head of the General Directorate of Publications and Press of the Ministry of National Economy and later worked at the Royal Library (current Golestan Palace Library).

Despite his governmental roles, Mo’ayyeri’s  true passion lay in poetry and music. His poetic journey was marked by a deep affection for ghazals, finding them the most expressive form for conveying romantic sentiments. He famously said, "In all types of poetry, like odes, ghazals, masnavi, and rubaiyat, I have composed works, but I have a special affinity for ghazals, as they allow one to better express romantic emotions and feelings."

Rahi Moayeri chose the pen name "Rahi" (meaning 'pathfinder' or 'guide') to signify his role as a guide in the realm of poetry and literature. This choice reflects his poetic vision and aspiration to guide readers through the artistic and emotional landscapes of his works. The name aligns with the tradition of Persian poets adopting pen names that often embody their poetic persona, philosophy, or style.

Rahi primarily wrote ghazals and songs but also ventured into humorous, social, and patriotic poetry. He collaborated with Tehran Illustrated, Baba Shaml, and Tofigh, publishing critical poems under pseudonyms like "Zaghcheh (jackdaw),"  "Shah-pariyun (king of fairies)," and "Haq-goo (truth-sayer)." He was also responsible for the poetry page in the national weekly Ettela'at newspaper.

His love life, particularly his unrequited love for Maryam Firouz, a prominent figure in Iranian politics and society, profoundly influenced his poetry. This relationship, though not culminating in marriage, inspired many of his works. Moayeri never married, maintaining a lifelong bachelor status; but many of his poems are dedicated to "Maryam." He actively participated in literary circles, including the Hakim Nezami Literary Society headed by Vahid Dastgerdi, and associated with prominent contemporary poets and writers.

In his later years, Moayeri contributed significantly to Persian music, collaborating with legends like Gholam Hossein Banan and Mohammad Reza Shajarian. His compositions remain timeless, echoing the depth of Persian lyrical tradition. A member of the Iranian Music Association, Rahi excelled also in composing music. He played a vital role in the radio program "Golha-ye Rangarang," selecting poetry and leading the program after Davood Pirnia, and collaborated with renowned musicians like Rouhollah Khaleghi, Morteza Mahjoubi, and Ali Tajvidi. 

Even today, his ghazals and lyrical poems retain such appeal that they are sung by  highly regarded vocalists as Mohammad Reza Shajarian, his son Homayun, Marzieh, Delkash, Banan, Golpayegani, Ghavami, among others.

Rahi Moayeri passed away on November 15, 1968, after a prolonged battle with stomach cancer. He was laid to rest in the Zahir-od-Dowleh cemetery in Tehran. His chosen epitaph, "When you see a lover, remember Rahi!" resonates with the essence of his life—a testament to love, poetry, and the enduring spirit of a passionate soul.
