### Abu Abdullah Jafar ibn Muhammad Rudaki

![[Rudaki.png]]
Revered as the "Sultan of Poets" and widely acknowledged as the father of Persian poetry, Rudaki was the first to compose extensively in Modern Persian, effectively setting a precedent for future generations of poets. His melodious voice and proficiency with the chang (a stringed instrument) further accentuated his stature as a masterful bard. 

Abu Abdullah Jafar ibn Muhammad, known as Rudaki, emerged in the midst of the third Islamic century, around the year 244 AH (858-859 CE), in the village of Banj, within the Rudak area of Samarkand.

His life is emblematic of the poetic and cultural renaissance during the Samanid era; his work graced the courts, where he was held in high esteem by the Samanid sovereigns. Although later life saw him fall from royal favour, potentially due to political turmoil or court intrigues, the influence of his work remained undiminished. The breadth of his poetry encompassed qasidas (odes), ghazals, and even the narrative poetry of mathnawis, showcasing his versatility and prowess across poetic forms.

Rudaki's influence extended beyond mere literary acclaim; there is an oft-retold account that his poetic performance was so powerful that it is said to have persuaded Amir Nasr to end a prolonged sojourn in Badghis and return to Bukhara, a testament to his influence esteemed position at court with his most famous poem to contemporary Iranians:

_mir māh ast o Boxārā asemān_  
_māh su-ye asemān āyad hami_  
_mir sarvast o Boḵārā bustān_  
_Sarv su-ye bustān āyad hami_


The Moon’s the Prince, Bukhárá is the sky;  
O Sky, the Moon shall light thee by and by!  
Bukhárá is the mead, the Cypress he;  
Receive at last, O Mead, thy Cypress-tree!

<sub><font color="#7f7f7f">(Translation quoted from Browne, E in Encyclopaedia Iranica Online] </font></sub>

but not before delivering this emotional hook: 

_bu-ye ju-ye Muliān āyad hami_  
The fragrance of _Múliyán’s_ brook comes to mind,  
_yād-e yār-e mehrbān āyad hami_  
Of the loved friend reminding, who was left behind  

The prince, moved by Rudaki's verse, reportedly mounted his steed and galloped back to the city before the poet could finish.

The exact circumstances around Rudaki's blindness are clouded in historical ambiguity. Some narratives suggest he was born blind, while others propose that his blindness was a consequence of later events. Nonetheless, the vivid imagery and rich descriptions within his verses argue against congenital blindness. This sensory detail infuses his work with life that resonates with colour and vibrancy, challenging the notion that he never witnessed the world's visual splendours.

Rudaki's oeuvre was colossal, with some accounts citing over a million verses, although only a fraction has survived the test of time. His poetry, often imbued with themes of nature, joy, and the passage of time, remains a testament to his enduring legacy. His style—simple yet profound, local yet universal—was distinctive for its clarity and lyrical quality, which has made it endearing to generations of readers and scholars alike. Rudaki’s influence extended beyond the literary, as he also contributed to the Persian renaissance by retranslating the fables of "Kalileh va Demneh," enriching Persian literature with his adaptations.

In his twilight years, Rudaki retreated to his birthplace, where he ultimately passed away in 329 AH (941 CE). His end was marked by a return to simplicity, a stark contrast to his years of courtly grandeur. Yet, the melancholy of his later poems, such as his "Lament in Old Age," casts a poignant reflection on the transient nature of fortune and fame. The legacy of Rudaki endures as a cornerstone of Persian literary heritage, his verses a mirror to the soul of an era and a voice that continues to echo through the corridors of time.
