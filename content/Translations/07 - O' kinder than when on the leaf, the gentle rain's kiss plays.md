O' kinder than when on the leaf, 
The gentle rain's kiss plays,  
Awakening of stars  
Under the brooklet's tender gaze  

The mirror of your eye   
Is where the dawn and ocean meet,  
Your rare smile is a dawn aglow,  
Where bright stars are replete.  

Come back!  
For your absence raises my silent, maddened cries,  
And from the rocks of mountainscapes  
their mournful echo flies.  

Oâ€™ flowing stream,  
From close by this leafy shade do not stray,  
For there are many who have let such chances slip away.  

You spoke of days when love had taken root,  
And I replied:  
Though days may march and ages turn,  
That love will still abide.  

Estrangement is beyond what we can bear,  
Dear one! Don't shun  
This lover,  
Burdened with regret,  
Leading those come undone.  

Before we came,  
A multitude have lived and left their trace:  
On life's grand wall,  
A chronicle that time cannot erase.  

After us,  
This love's melody shall evermore remain,  
As long as will exist  
The timeless song of wind and rain.
