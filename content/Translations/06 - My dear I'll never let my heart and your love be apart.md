![[006 - My dear I'll never let my heart and your love be apart.png]]


My dear,  
I'll never let my heart and your love be apart,  
I am your captive, though I'm free -   
forever bound at heart.  

From time eternal,   
your love and my soul have been entwined,   
From loving you, in this life no salvation I will find.  

From all but you,  
My heart and soul 
I've cleansed away desire,  
And like a censer full of flame,
your love fills me with fire.  

Over this world and after,  
To your love my heart is bound  
Upon this path toward you,   
I throw my pride to the ground.  

Since I have seen your smile,   
Like pearls in laughter's bright array,  
My eyes,  
Like jeweled streams,  
Are weeping rubies night and day.  

Since grief for you,  
like armies fierce,  
has seized my heart and mind,  
Prudence and reputation to the winds I have resigned.
