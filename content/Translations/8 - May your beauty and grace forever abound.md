![[8 - May your beauty and grace forever abound.png]]
 
 May your beauty and grace forever abound,    
 May your face like tulips glow all year around.    
 
 May thoughts of your love in our hearts always stay,    
 May they flourish and grow with every passing day    
 
 May cypresses - that in the meadow do grow,    
 Out of respect for your stature, bow down low    
 
 May eyes - not swayed by your charm - weep in woe,    
 Their tears stained with blood in their pearlescent flow    
 
 To fascinate souls and to captivate hearts,    
 May your eyes excel in the magical arts.    
 
 May every heart that with your longing is found    
 Be restless and yearning, and in turmoil bound    
 
 May all the world's charmers to you yield their place,     
 As 'Noon' bows to 'Alef', in reverent grace    
 
 May those who of your love are empty at heart,    
 From your union's circle stay ever apart.    
 
 The soul of Hafez is on your lips defined,    
 May those rubies be far from the unrefined.
