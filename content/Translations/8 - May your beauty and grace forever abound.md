![[8 - May your beauty and grace forever abound.png]]
 
 May your beauty and grace forever abound,    
 May your face like tulips glow all year around.    
 
 May thoughts of your love in our hearts always stay,    
 May they flourish and grow with every passing day    
 
 May cypresses - that in the meadow do grow,    
 Out of respect for your stature, bow down low    
 
 May the eye that’s not swayed by your charm weep in woe,    
 Its tears stained with blood in their pearlescent flow    
 
 To fascinate souls and to captivate hearts,    
 May your eyes excel in the magical arts.    
 
 May every heart that with your longing is found,    
 Be restless and yearning, and in turmoil bound    
 
 May all the world's charmers to you yield their place,     
 As 'Noon' bows to 'Alef', in reverent grace    
 
 May those who of your love are empty at heart,    
 From your union's circle stay ever apart.    
 
 The soul of Hafez is on your lips defined,    
 May those rubies be far from the unrefined. 


# Translator's Notes

**Cultural**: Capturing the essence of Persian cultural references like the cypress and tulips, which have specific connotations in Persian literature and symbolism;
- **Cypress Trees**: In Persian poetry, cypress trees symbolize the beloved or the divine. They stand tall and elegant, reaching towards the heavens, often associated with immortality and the soul's ascension in Sufi thought.
    
- **Tulips**: Tulips are used symbolically to represent the beauty of the beloved and the color of passion. The redness of tulips mirrors the spiritual fervor and intensity of love, especially in the context of divine or mystical love.
    
- **Longing and Yearning**: Central to Sufi thought, the themes of longing and yearning are prevalent in Hafez's poetry. This longing signifies the soul's desire to reunite with the divine, mirroring the lover's intense yearning for the beloved.
    
- **Turmoil and Restlessness**: The imagery of turmoil and restlessness reflects the inner conflict and the soul's journey through the world. In Sufi philosophy, it symbolizes the search for spiritual fulfillment and divine love, which is a recurring theme in Hafez's poetry.
- **Alef and Noon (الف - Alef and نون - Noon):** Aleph and Noon have a symbolic significance in their orthographic forms as straight and curved lines, respectively. This symbolism is associated with the concepts of beginning and end, as well as the idea of a journey from the initial point to the final destination. In the poem, Aleph (ا) and Noon (ن) serve as symbols for stature and humility. 
	The Aleph, a straight and upright line, often represents the beloved or the divine. Its simplicity and verticality can be seen as a symbol of perfection or an ideal to aspire to. In Persian calligraphy, Aleph's straightness is associated with strength, stability, and a kind of majestic simplicity.

	Noon, on the other hand, with its curved shape ending in a downward sweep, can represent the act of bowing or humility. The curve of the Noon, especially as it bends towards the Aleph, is symbolic of a devotee or a lover bowing in respect and humility towards the beloved or the divine.
	
	In the specific context of the poem, this imagery beautifully captures the essence of reverence and humility. It conveys a sense of profound respect and admiration that the lover or the seeker has for the beloved or the divine. This act of bowing or lowering oneself (symbolized by Noon) in the presence of the beloved or the divine (symbolized by Aleph) is a recurring theme in Persian Sufi poetry, embodying the spiritual journey of humility, love, and ultimate union with the divine. This interpretation highlights the depth and richness of Sufi symbolism in Hafez's poetry, where even the form of letters carries profound spiritual meanings.
