Rejoice, rejoice!  
I am the one who’s chosen by my love!  
I am her shadow now;  
To her sun she raised me above.  

I am the life of heart and eye,  
the very tears of mirth,  
The worthy, favoured, chosen one— 
My love has seen my worth.  

Direct your prayers to me,  
as I am the Ka'bah, blessed;  
That guiding idol bent down  
and on me her kiss impressed.    

Her lovely visage lights my eyes,  
in joyous clarity,  
A mirror faced a mirror;  
I saw her and she saw me.  
  
The mirror turns to radiant sun  
beside her face so fair,  
See how the mirror shines on me    
if gazing you can bear.  
  
Once lost,   
This gem now brightly shines  
upon the heavens' crest,  
A kindly jeweler came  
and put my value to the test.  
  
As light in fountains leaps    
and on my face its kisses land,    
Solomon's envy,  
Jamshid's awe of me you'll understand.  
  
Each morn from her abode of grace,  
as I look down, I hear,  
'Praise be!' the moon and Venus sing,  
their voices ringing near  
  
Just like her dark hair,  
from her lovely face I shall not stray,  
May a hundred brilliant mornings  
break from this night, bringing day.  
  
Robeless, I am a radiant ray,  
a soul from body free,  
Till I'm my shadow once again,  
in sight I shall not be.



# Translator's Notes

A particular focus was placed on maintaining the symbolic elements such as mirrors, light, and celestial bodies, which are deeply rooted in Persian poetic tradition and Sufi mysticism - and Sayeh’s own literary ontology, where even his own pen-name is derived from an interaction of light - *Sayeh* meaning “shadow”.

The decision to adapt the poem into iambic heptameter was made to reflect the flowing nature of the Persian text and to provide a rhythmic structure that could carry the weight of Sayeh's themes. This meter was chosen for its natural cadence in English, providing a balanced and harmonious flow that echoes the original's music.

### Cultural/Poetic notes


1. **Ka’bah and Qibla**: 
   - *Ka’bah*: A building at the center of Islam's most important mosque, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is a cube-shaped building, and the most sacred site in Islam.
   - *Qibla*: The direction that Muslims face when praying, which is towards the Ka’bah in Mecca.

2. That guiding idol bent and on me her kiss impressed:
   - This line uses the imagery of a revered idol, symbolizing the beloved in her beauty, who bestows a kiss— a gesture that marks, sanctifies and makes holy. This metaphorically represents the transformative power of the beloved's love and approval. The "guiding idol"  shows the direction of the  Ka’ba for prayer, bending down and placing a kiss on the Kaaba, a symbolic act that elevates the Kaaba's status and transforms it from a simple structure to a holy site. The kiss can be interpreted as a blessing or recognition, imbuing the poet with immense importance and respect, elevating him with a kiss to divine sanctity.

The poem's use of the idol creates a paradox: Islam is monotheistic, worshipping one God (Allah). Idols, associated with pagan religions, traditionally contradict this belief. The poem uses this contrast – the "unholy" idol blessing the Kaaba – to create a powerful effect.

3. **Mirror Imagery**:
   - **Footnote**: "Mirrors facing each other symbolize mutual recognition and reflection of the self in the other, a theme common in Persian poetry that explores the unity and deep connection between lovers."

4. **Solomon’s envy, Jamshid’s awe**:
   - *Solomon*: A prophet and king in Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions, known for his wisdom and the ability to communicate with animals and jinn.
   - *Jamshid*: A mythical king in Persian literature, credited with many inventions and discoveries, often associated with a divinely endowed cup (Jam-e Jam) that reveals the universe's secrets.
   - The reference to Solomon's envy and Jamshid's awe suggests that the poet's elevated state, achieved through love, would inspire jealousy in a wise king and awe in a legendary figure with access to divine knowledge, highlighting the transformative and exalted nature of love.

5. **‘Praise be,’ the moon and Venus sing**:
   - **Footnote**: "This line personifies the moon and Venus, celestial bodies often associated with beauty and love, as singing 'Praise be' (an expression of gratitude or admiration), suggesting that even the cosmos celebrates the poet's joy and transformation through love."

6. **Robeless, I am a radiant ray — a soul from body free**:
   - **Footnote**: "The imagery of being 'robeless' and a 'radiant ray' symbolizes liberation and purity of the soul, freed from the physical constraints of the body, reflecting Sufi themes of spiritual transcendence and unity with the divine."
