 Roil! boil with love's tide - 
 we are clad in the sea,    
 love is our only cause,  
 and our only decree.           
 
 In this sacred land,  
 love’s the seed that we sow,   
 For love alone is  
 what we are meant to grow.
 
 From that sovereign's grace,  
 high and drunken we are,  
 Come, come! Raise your hands,  
 for our reign's not afar! 
  
 What strange brew was it  
 that we drank yesternight?    
 It’s left us drunk and hungover  
 in the daylight.          
 
 Ask not!  
 Not to know of the truth of our state;              
 To us wine is what counts,  
 not the cups that we sate.            
 
 Can one who's not drunken of love's heady wine,       
 Know of the pursuit in which we intertwine?            
 
 We will not fall here,  
 like so much straw and hay,      
 We’ll rise to the wheel:  
 challengers who will stay.
