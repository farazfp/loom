 Roil! boil with love's tide - we are clad in the sea,    
 Love alone is our cause, and our only decree.           
 
 In this sacred land, love’s the seed that we sow,   
 For love alone is what we are meant to grow.
 
 From that sovereign's grace, high and drunken we are,  
 Come, come! Raise your hands, for our reign's not afar! 
 
 No clue, what strange brew did we drink yesternight?    
 It has left us drunk and hungover in the daylight.          
 
 Ask not! Not to fathom our verity's state;              
 We venerate wine, not the cups that we sate.            
 
 Can one who's not drunken with love's heady wine,       
 Perceive the pursuit in which we intertwine?            
 
 We will not fall here, like so much straw and hay,      
 We’ll rise to the wheel: challengers who will stay.
