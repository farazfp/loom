In your unkindness heavenward my soul's smoke swirls and twirls  
Cease this wrong, lest foes find joy as my suffering unfurls.

Don't make more smoke nor give more joy to the envious heart  
Ah, how their glee would surge high, with my being torn apart.  
  
Sweeten, not bitter my hope, O my pure sweet sugar white,  
Lest in despair, I rend and tear my dark cloak in my plight.  
  
You are my ally and my love, and my prosperity  
You are my garden, my springâ€™s charm; for you, my entity.  
  
You have taken away my sleep; my solace, you have been,  
You have shown me torment, and it is only you I win.  
  
My all! My life and world; My heavens' Venus, shining bright!  
Your fire is my mark, in my heart like incense alight.  
  
There was no body, I was soul; with you, up in the sky,  
Nothing existed in between! My word and my reply
