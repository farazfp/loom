![[010 - Heavenward my soul's smoke swirls and twirls.png]]  

In your unkindness heavenward,  
My soul's smoke swirls and twirls.  
Drop this spite  
and don't let rivals smile as my pain unfurls.  


Don't make more smoke,  
Nor give more joy,  
To the envious heart -   
Ah, how their glee would surge high!  
With my being torn apart.  
  
Sweeten, not bitter my hope,  
O my pure sweet sugar white,  
Lest in despair,  
I rend and tear my dark cloak in my plight.  
  
You are my ally and my love,  
And my prosperity  
You are my garden,  
My springâ€™s charm;  
for you, my entity.  
  
You have taken away my sleep;  
My solace, you have been,  
You have shown me torment,  
And you are all that I can win.  
  
My all! My life and world;  
My heavens' Venus  
Shining bright!  
Your fire is my mark,  
In my heart, like incense alight.  
  
There was no body, I was soul;  
With you, up in the sky,   
Nothing existed in between!  
My word and my reply
