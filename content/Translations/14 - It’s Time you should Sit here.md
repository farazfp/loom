- Poet:  [[Sayeh]]


 It's time you should sit here and let loose your hair,  
 So I speak of the sorrows our nights used to bear.      
 Your feast has been calling; I've come to its call,     
 An incense that burns with no respite at all.           
 While trapped in the cage of its wings, it will stay,   
 The bird of the heavens will not find its way.          
 The harp, at the thought of your touch, starts to play; 
 What songs it will sing when you're near it someday.    
 A lifetime we've waited for dawn's gentle breeze,       
 To carry a message that sets hearts at ease.            
 Woe be to the ear that can hear the reed's song,        
 Yet misses the piper whose truth comes along.           
 Pity the eye that does, by candlelight's glow,          
 See you reflected, yet knows not where you go.          
 You are a voice that soars, yet none ever hear,         
 Beyond the tight bounds of the listening ear.           
 Within the bright mirrors that shimmer with light,      
 The house of my eye holds a feast for your sight.       
 Each door you unlock in this mirror-clad space,         
 Opens to show you yourself, face to face.               
 Like shadow, this friend has embraced me so tight,      
 May our closeness bring joy through each day and night.
