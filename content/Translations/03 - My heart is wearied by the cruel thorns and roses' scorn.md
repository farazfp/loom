![[003 My heart is wearied.png]]

My heart is wearied  
By the cruel thorns and roses' scorn,  
Much like a breeze,  
From this garden I've quietly withdrawn.  

The candle of our joy,  
By fate into inferno turned,  
I paid for love with life  
But only sorrow have I earned.  

Life's harvest is the fellowship  
That does companions bind,  
Since from me you've departed,  
I have left the world behind.  

When you were near,  
My heart had peace, 
Its place, its firmest ground,  
Your parting took that peace away,  
and left my heart unbound.  

When your love grants my heart's plea,  
By then I will be no more,  
When you do heed my cry at last,  
I'll be with God for sure.  

When springtime wakes the tulips  
From my earthly bed to grow,  
O' new bloom! 
Spare a thought for my heart,  
And its pain and woe.  

Either come on the path of faith,  
Or be gone from my heart;  
This life — burnt in your wait —  
I am now ready to depart.
