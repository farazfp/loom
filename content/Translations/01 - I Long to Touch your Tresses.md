![[001 - I long to touch your tresses.png]]

I long to touch your tresses—  
    With #ambergris’ fragrance graced;  
Upon your tender #jasmine bloom,  
    My kisses will be traced.  

Wherever it is that you walk,  
    Your feet will bless the earth;  
A thousand prostrations I’ll make  
    In honour of its worth.

A thousand kisses I shall place  
Upon your letter's fold,  
If on its seal  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ring's imprint  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I joyfully behold.

The keenest blade of India  
Could have my hand to take;  
If just to hold your garment's hem,  
This sacrifice I'd make.   

Though silence may befall me  
When they ask me to recite,   
In your praise on my zealous tongue,  
The words always alight!
