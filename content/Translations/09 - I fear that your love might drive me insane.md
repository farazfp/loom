![[009 - I fear that your love might drive me insane.png]]  

I fear that your love may drive me insane,    
In town, our tale of ill fame could remain.  

All faith and reason I have left for you,    
Your grief may unbind me and my life too.    
  
Your absence has made me thin like a hair,    
A strand of your locks can my being ensnare.    
  
I plead for freedom from your tresses' chains,    
Lest in their bond all my sanity drains.    
  
Within your curls I'll fall so thin and slight,    
That one stray hair that's brushed away from sight.    
  
Last night I drank so that with thoughts of you,    
Today, just one cup makes me drunken too.    
  
Like candles to idols, bring forth your  light,    
Draw near - and moth-like to you, I'll take flight.
