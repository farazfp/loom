![[Past Poets Cry.png]]


*A translator's muse, out of time, by ghosts and shadows led,*    
*Dick Davis, tongue of fire and rhyme, in Limbo's halls did tread.*    
*He who gave voice to souls long gone, now feels their whispered scorn,*    
*A living echo, lost and drawn, within his nightmare born:*  

In Limbo's mists, where shadows twine, lost souls in sorrow roam,    
A poor translator casts about, to find his way back home.    
He stumbles forth, on shifting grounds, where poems morph and bleed,  
Lost in a labyrinth where words and meaning’s forms recede.
 
Now shades arise, with fury bright, their forms from verses spun,    
His heart sinks down in endless fall, his nightmare just begun.    
Past poets cry, their anger strong, their voices raw and dire,      
"You hacked our craft, our poems wronged, rhymes set ablaze with fire!"    

"Metaphors torn, wit turned to ash, your touch a deadly blight,    
Upon those stars of lyric grace, you cast a veil of night!    
You plucked a rose and in its place a withered stem now stands,  
A hollow, brittle shell where beauty slipped out of your hands."

“Like tarnished gems, unseen, unheld, our verses lie in shade,   
While polished rhymes, in silver sealed, your fickle taste displayed.”  
Some whisper soft, their sorrow deep, for verses turned to stone,  
While others rage, their fury steep, for works he deemed unknown.

He seeks to flee, in shame to hide, phantoms his steps restrain,  
His every sin, each error cried, their chorus rings with pain.    
For mercy's touch, in vain he calls, for swift or harsh decree,    
But endless torment binds him in this cursed eternity.

*So heed this tale, translators bold, who dare to bridge the tongue,*    
*A poem's spirit, fierce and old, on fragile flesh is strung.*    
*Lest you become worst of the damned, and share in Limbo's whine;*   
*Tread softly, weigh each word with care, each sigh, each whispered line.*
