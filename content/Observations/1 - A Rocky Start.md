This proved to be a very rough start. ChatGPT has trouble with prosody, speech-related linguistic features and even counting syllables. The reason for its shortcomings in these areas is that ChatGPT's training does not involve auditory processing or the nuances of spoken language. Its algorithms are not designed for the intricate task of analyzing speech patterns, which requires an understanding of stress, intonation, and rhythm — components that are intrinsic to prosody. It operates primarily on text-based data and lacks the capacity to process audio input in a way that a human brain does, with its innate ability to perceive subtle variations in spoken language. Hence, while it may statistically approximate syllable patterns based on textual data, it does not "hear" or "feel" the natural flow of speech, leading to potential inaccuracies in tasks like syllable counting or replicating the natural cadence of human speech.

This absence of auditory processing and speech-related comprehension has a profound impact on the model's poetic sensibilities. Poetry, at its core, is not merely about the words on the page but also about the rhythm, sound, and emotional resonance that come alive when it is spoken. Poetic devices such as meter, rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and consonance all rely heavily on sound patterns that are naturally grasped by the human ear.

A large language model, functioning without the ability to process these auditory cues, can only simulate an understanding of these elements based on textual patterns it has been trained on. It can identify and generate text that statistically resembles poetry by following learned rules and recognized structures, but it cannot fully appreciate the musicality of poetry that is so essential to its art form.

For example, while ChatGPT can be programmed to count syllables and possibly even to place them in a pattern resembling a sonnet or a haiku, it lacks the ability to truly understand why a particular turn of phrase is more pleasing to the ear or evokes a stronger emotional response. It does not experience rhythm or the natural pauses for breath that give poetry its life. Consequently, while it might produce text that looks correct on paper, it might miss the mark in capturing the essence of what makes poetry feel, to the human ear and heart, genuinely poetic.

These could have implications on how to (re)train future models to focus on poetic creation. In the meantime, I had best give very specific instructions, be wary of its adherence to them and be mindful to separate and detail prosodic features and see what works best.
