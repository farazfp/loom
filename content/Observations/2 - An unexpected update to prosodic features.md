As it would appear, ChatGPT now counts syllables almost perfectly. All that is needed is for it to be prompted to 

“do a full syllable count, including every single syllable and marking it clearly with a slash. For instance, “Your beauty” becomes “Your (1)/ Beau(2)/ty(3)/”. Then count the syllables”

To help with poetic creation, I have been able to couple this with the syllable count of the meter we are working in (e.g. dactylic tetrameter) and 

“ if the syllables do not match *n* (the syllable count of the meter, e.g. 11) then iteratively refine and adjust accordingly until they do.” 

It is not perfect but is a massive improvement to the previous hopeless cases where things were even visibly not correct. I have incorporated this into the “GPT” so that it can be reused as required without the need for explicit reprompting each time.
